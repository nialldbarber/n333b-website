<HeaderOne>Creating your own TypeScript Utility Type</HeaderOne>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Paragraph>One of my favourite repos on TypeScript is <Highlight><a href="https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges" target="_blank">Type Challenges</a></Highlight>. It sets you challenges to rewrite TypeScript utility types from scratch, so you can get a better understanding of how TypeScript works under the hood.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>But, what exactly is a TypeScript utility type? </Paragraph>

<Paragraph level="2" id="pick">
  Pick
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>Let's take the `Pick<T>` utility type as an example. TypeScript gives you a utility type where you can _select_ an item from a type and create a new type from that.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>An example:</Paragraph>

```ts
// Create a type:
type Fruit = {
  favourite: "banana";
  meh: "apple";
  yuck: "orange";
};

// Pick an item from that type:
type Apple = Pick<Fruit, "meh">;
//     ^? type Apple = { meh: "apple" }
```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Paragraph>Seems pretty self-explanatory! But how does this utility actually work? To first understand this, let's drill down to the absolute basics.</Paragraph>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Paragraph>If you hover your cursor over the `Pick` utility, you'll see exactly how the utility is made:</Paragraph>

```ts
type Apple = Pick<Fruit, "meh">;
```

<Paragraph level="2" id="generics">
  Generics
</Paragraph>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Paragraph>The answer lies in Generics! Generics are the type equivalent of function parameters; they make types more reuseable!</Paragraph>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Paragraph>Let's compare a function and a type together to demonstrate this:</Paragraph>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
function addNumbers(x, y) {
  return x + y; //  ^  ^ - these are parameters. They are dynamic
}               //         and produce different results based on
                //         different input!
```

<Paragraph>Let's try this with a type now:</Paragraph>

```ts
type AddNumbers<X, Y> = {
  x: X;
  y: Y;
};
```

</Stack>
